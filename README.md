# Exercism Solutions

This is some solutions that I created 2 years ago when I was learning better coding practices and improving my Javascript language.

I am putting here to have a record inside my Github. This was exported from this personal [Gitlab Repository](https://gitlab.com/ismaelpereira/exercism-solutions) to be centralized.

There are some branches created for exercises and on the master we have more.

## How to use


2. Just run a `cd <exercise-name>` and run `npm i` and `npm run test`

3. Some tests should be uncomented. Just enter on the **.spec.ts* and remove the **X** where it's writter `xtest`
