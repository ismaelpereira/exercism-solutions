# Anagram

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

# Acronym

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).
